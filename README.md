# Ember-Titanium Submodule

This is an experimental version of [Ember-Titanium](https://github.com/ebryn/ember-titanium). Use at your own risk. I do.

The goal of this fork of Ember-Titanium is for maximum code reuse and apps that load as fast as possible by not reading JS that isn't used.

## Add Ember-Titanium to your Titanium Project

Use this command in Terminal while in the root directory of your Titanium project:

`$ git submodule add git://github.com/brianpattison/ember-titanium-submodule.git Resources/lib/em_ti`

## Example App
